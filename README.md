# Report Demo App
The image file from the sample report is not properly loading when running the app locally (I have not deployed it to test it on a server). The image is imbedded.

I have embedded the following image into my report:
![Report Logo](images/ReportIcon.png)

Here is what happens when I run the application:
![Report with missing image](images/MissingImage.png)

When I export the report to PDF, the image shows up:
![Report with image present](images/ExportedPDF.png)
